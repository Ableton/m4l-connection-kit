# Abstract

This device brings inside Live webcam data in order to control mappable parameters. 

# Prerequisites

* If your computer does not have a built in web camera, you will need to connect one.


# Guidelines

* On the left side, select your video source (if there is more than one).

* Click start/stop camera to start/stop the flow of video data.

* In the small screen you can click on an object of a particular colour, preferably something bright. 

* Then, play around with the “Threshold” parameter until you find the right amount; as you move your object around, the red spot on the big screen should follow it. 
Note that the lighting conditions can drastically affect how colours appear on the camera and therefore the response of the device, so make sure you are in a well lit environment.


* You can limit the output value range by adjusting the “min” and “max” fields (in %). If min is set to a value greater than max, then their behaviour is inverted.

* Alternatively, with the camera deactivated, you can move the dot with your mouse, as you would do with an XY plane, in order to control the mapped parameters.
